# Full-Project-on-Excel-bike-sales-analysis-dashboard

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of bike sales, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized in Microsoft Excel to provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards. The main objectives of this project were to identify key trends in sales performance, customer demographics, and product preferences.

# Key Features:

# Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
Standardized data for consistent formatting (e.g., dates, currency, and numerical fields).

# Pivot Table Analysis:
Created pivot tables to summarize sales data by key categories (e.g., product type, sales region, customer segments).
Used calculated fields to measure metrics like total sales, average revenue per customer, and regional performance.

# Data Visualization:
Developed charts (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to represent key insights such as sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences over time.
These visualizations helped to identify patterns and support decision-making.

# Interactive Dashboard:
Built a user-friendly dashboard incorporating slicers and dynamic charts to enable easy filtering and exploration of the data.
The dashboard allows users to interact with sales data by product category, region, and time.

# Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, pivot table creation, charting, and dashboard development)
Kaggle (for sourcing the dataset)

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle's Bike Sales Dataset.

# Objective:
This project aims to demonstrate Excel's capabilities for data cleaning, visualization, and dashboarding while providing insights into bike sales performance.
